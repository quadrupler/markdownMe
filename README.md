# markdownMe

## The Problem
Creating Documentation that other people find satisfying is potentially the most annoying part of creating an application. 
I'd rather clean out a septic tank than write documentation.

## The Solution
The solution is to significantly improve the process of creating documentation on Github. Markdown is something that can be dreaded or be more potentially. Thats
where markdownMe comes into play. This Repo will significantly improve the process of creating README's.

## Features

Currently creating features that you may find compelling. The MVP will be completed within the next two weeks and I look forward to hearing what you have to say about
it.
