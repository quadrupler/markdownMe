# Markdown Inspiration

Markdown Inspiration is a simple static text website built with the purpose of helping everybody in the GitHub Community have an easier time building beautiful markdown whether it be for an open source project, a Developer wanting to have a beautiful GitHub profile or even a developer who is trying to make a beautiful Portfolio to help stand out of the crowd to get their first Software Development job!

## User Stories

- [ ] When I load the page I should be greeted with a splash page that encourages me to continue scrolling
- [ ] When I visit a page for the first time I should see a section talking about the importance of great markdown and after that I shouldn't see that section anymore
- [ ] When I click on Github Profiles or Documentation Examples I should see a section appear with examples I can pick from
- [ ] While looking at the markdown examples I should be able to see who built the template and be able to see there profile to give credit
- [ ] When I click on an example a markdown editor should appear where I can then edit the template and see the changes I make
- [ ] When I am accessing the site on a mobile device or equivalent width I shouldn't be able to access the editor and only be able to see the template I'm editing or examples in a mobile format so I can see if it's viewable on mobile
- [ ] While editing a template I should be able to click on instructions and have different markdown options listed that I can click on and see an example of the inputs and outputs so I know how to use it.
- [ ] I should be able to submit my own template and allow it to be added to the examples given on the site

### This Branch is Still in Development

Just added these two quick blurbs to state the two User Personas that this website will be trying to reach out to. The finally README will look nothing like this lol.
